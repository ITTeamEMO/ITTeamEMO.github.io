											After all six members of the group took the MBTI personality test and the learning style test, the following results were obtained: 
											three members of the group were all ENFJ-A personalities, while the remaining three were ESFJ-A, ENFJ-A, and ISTP-T types. 
											In the Learning Style test, three of the group tended to be visual learners while the remaining three styles were auditory learning style, 
											theoretical learning style, and kinesthetic learning style.

                                        <img src="assets/css/images/Learning Style.png" alt="" height="440px" />
										
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											<br>
											The two pie charts provided show that the ENFJ-A personality type, as well as the visual learning style, made up half of the group. 
											Although half of the team members were of the same personality type, this does not indicate that the group members with more identical types of personality 
											as well as learning styles could not help the team succeed.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											Through the MBTI personality test, we can learn and understand separately that group members help to:<br>
											1. Bring out individual strengths.<br>
											2. Avoid and resolve conflicts.<br>
											3. Work together more effectively.<br>
											4. Be able to self-understand and understand others, thus reducing the stress of group work.<br>
											5. Identify gaps in the group and develop effective plans to address them.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											Four of our group members are intuitive ENFJ types, and ENFJ personalities are generally idealistic, preferring to envision an ideal world and wanting to work 
											toward creating that vision. I don't think excessive idealism is good for group work because it can lead to group members feeling good about themselves and sometimes 
											being overly optimistic when faced with a problem and thus unable to complete a task with care. But they can also be genuinely motivated by what they believe to be real 
											goals and sensitive to the emotional needs of others. These types of personalities are good at building on the talents of others because they have a strong desire for 
											harmony and are good at resolving conflicts.<br>
											<br>
											In real group work, I think these types of personalities are good at motivating the group and do not make group work difficult to coordinate because they are generally
											 outgoing and good at resolving conflicts that arise from a lack of authentic communication in the group. They can also lead our team to explore our group learning style.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											Another member of our group is an ESFJ with a sensing judgment type and an ISTP with an intuitive feeling type. The ESFJ type is more of a consul and excels at analyzing 
											options and developing realistic plans because they are more focused on traditional methods and believe that these traditional methods provide security, stability, and a 
											sense of belonging to each plan.<br>
											<br>
											ISTP personalities are intuitive perception types who can observe their environment keenly and can improvise solutions to crises that the group may face. By having an ISTP 
											type in the group, we can avoid excessive optimism about the future due to too many ENFJ-type idealists.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											So I think our group is balanced and diverse. Idealists and consuls ensure harmony and perfect coordination among the group members, while intuitive types of teammates are 
											keen to identify problems with the plan and provide the most effective solutions.
