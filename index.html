										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											After all six members of the group took the MBTI personality test and the learning style test, the following results were obtained: 
											three members of the group were all ENFJ-A personalities, while the remaining three were ESFJ-A, ENFJ-A, and ISTP-T types. 
											In the Learning Style test, three of the group tended to be visual learners while the remaining three styles were auditory learning style, 
											theoretical learning style, and kinesthetic learning style.
										</p>
									</div>
										<img src="assets/css/images/MBTI.png" alt="" height="440px" />
										<img src="assets/css/images/Learning Style.png" alt="" height="440px" />
										
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											<br>
											The two pie charts provided show that the ENFJ-A personality type, as well as the visual learning style, made up half of the group. 
											Although half of the team members were of the same personality type, this does not indicate that the group members with more identical types of personality 
											as well as learning styles could not help the team succeed.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											Through the MBTI personality test, we can learn and understand separately that group members help to:<br>
											1. Bring out individual strengths.<br>
											2. Avoid and resolve conflicts.<br>
											3. Work together more effectively.<br>
											4. Be able to self-understand and understand others, thus reducing the stress of group work.<br>
											5. Identify gaps in the group and develop effective plans to address them.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											Four of our group members are intuitive ENFJ types, and ENFJ personalities are generally idealistic, preferring to envision an ideal world and wanting to work 
											toward creating that vision. I don't think excessive idealism is good for group work because it can lead to group members feeling good about themselves and sometimes 
											being overly optimistic when faced with a problem and thus unable to complete a task with care. But they can also be genuinely motivated by what they believe to be real 
											goals and sensitive to the emotional needs of others. These types of personalities are good at building on the talents of others because they have a strong desire for 
											harmony and are good at resolving conflicts.<br>
											<br>
											In real group work, I think these types of personalities are good at motivating the group and do not make group work difficult to coordinate because they are generally
											outgoing and good at resolving conflicts that arise from a lack of authentic communication in the group. They can also lead our team to explore our group learning style.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											Another member of our group is an ESFJ with a sensing judgment type and an ISTP with an intuitive feeling type. The ESFJ type is more of a consul and excels at analyzing 
											options and developing realistic plans because they are more focused on traditional methods and believe that these traditional methods provide security, stability, and a 
											sense of belonging to each plan.<br>
											<br>
											ISTP personalities are intuitive perception types who can observe their environment keenly and can improvise solutions to crises that the group may face. By having an ISTP 
											type in the group, we can avoid excessive optimism about the future due to too many ENFJ-type idealists.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: 25px;">
											So I think our group is balanced and diverse. Idealists and consuls ensure harmony and perfect coordination among the group members, while intuitive types of teammates are 
											keen to identify problems with the plan and provide the most effective solutions.

							<h1>Group Process</h1>
							<p>Welcome to our Group Process!<br>
							<p><li style="font-size: 25px;"><strong>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</strong></li><br>
								I think our group work was well done in Assignment 2. When assigning work, everyone coordinated with each other and no one shirked their responsibilities 
								and did not want to work. When a group member was in trouble, he also sought help from another teammate in a timely manner and everyone was happy to help him with his problem.<br>
								<br>
								Our group members are good communicators and are very good at expressing their ideas about assignments and answering questions from other group members at our weekly meetings. 
								During non-meeting times, we also communicate privately through other social media about our assignments, but most of the major issues are resolved through the weekly meetings, 
								which I think is the part of the group that we do well.<br>
								<br>
								So in Assignment 2, our group had a great time working together and are looking forward to the next one.
							</p>
							<p><li style="font-size: 25px;"><strong>Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3?</strong></li><br>
								During the process of completing Assignment 2, our group has had a couple of issues arising from poor communication, but none of them was particularly serious. 
								So our group's collaborative process should be more or less the same as in Assignment 2 and will not change particularly dramatically.<br>
								<br>
								We agreed that it was most important to assign work first, so whether we were doing the assignment or realising the project, the first thing to do was to clarify the division 
								of labour so that everyone could work together efficiently. Once the division of labour is clear, it's about each person working hard on their part. But this is not an assignment 
								for one person, it is an assignment for a team. Each part will be closely linked to the others, so friendly and efficient team communication is vital. In order to solve problems 
								in the assignment well, we all have group meetings twice a week as requested by our teachers, where we can solve problems in the assignment very well. So the flow of our group in Assignment 3 will not be very different from that in Assignment 2.<br>

						<h2>Compare and Contrast</h2>
						<p>The entire group took the Career View Assessment, which is based on our current perceptions of what we really want in our future jobs and what 
							we are willing and able to give. The assessment included four factors: income, hours of work, the impact of overtime, number of travel days, 
							and the ideal type of career, from which we could assess our apparent interests and the reasons for them.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>In the factor of job further income, all six people in our group were unanimous in their desire to increase from moderate to high income as their working age increased.</li>
							<li>In the factor of working hours, there was a difference in our group. Two group members believed that they were willing to gradually increase the number of hours worked 
								per day as their working age increased. The remaining four students, on the other hand, felt that as they got older, they did not think they were suited to working longer hours.</li>
							<li>In the factor of overtime hours, only one student in our group thought that as working age increases, overtime has less and less impact on subsequent work as well as study.</li>
							<li>In the item of the number of days of business trips, our group showed a polarization. Half of them thought that the number of travel days could be increased appropriately with 
								the increase of working age, while the other half thought that they could only travel 10-15 days per month, no matter how many years they worked.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The assessment provides three ideal career types: career-oriented, career-family balance, and family-oriented. From the pie chart below, it is clear that the most represented type
							 in our group is the career-family balance type, with three people. The second largest group is career-oriented, with two people, and the remaining one is family-oriented.
						</p>
						<span><img src="assets/css/images/Career Type.png" height="600px"></span>
						<p>
							From the above test, we can see that except for the job income, the six people in the group are not in complete agreement in other aspects, which shows that everyone's career plans are basically different at this stage.

						<h1>Project Description</h1>
						<p>Welcome to our Project Description!</p><br>

						<!--Overview-->
						<section id="five1">
							<h2>Overview</h2>
								<ul>
									<li id="five11"><h3>Topic</h3></li>
									<p>Nowadays, more and more people pay more attention to what they wear, but with the rapidly developing society, people can allocate very little time for comfortable research 
										on what to wear, so we designed the “Storage” app to solve this problem. The app will work with the checkroom we designed in assignment 2. Users can find the app in the app 
										store and use it by linking the Bluetooth of the fitting mirror in the checkroom.
									</p>
									<p>The app will collect the user's clothing data and provide the user with suitable outfit suggestions and fashion news that the user will like through big data, and will help the 
										user to automatically sort the clothing categories, reducing the amount of time the user spends on dressing and finding clothes. In addition to the core functions, the app also 
										comes with the function of managing the lights and environment of the smart checkroom, users can do remote control, not only to save energy but also to create a comfortable 
										changing environment. the app also comes with security control to prevent any accidents for the elderly and children at home, creating a new fitting experience for users.
									</p>
									<li id="five12"><h3>Motivation</h3></li>
									<p>
										When we discussed how to upgrade the checkroom together, we coincidentally thought of app development. Nowadays, more people choose to do everything on their cell phones, and with 
										just two easy clicks, you can do anything you want, which is the convenience that the Internet brings to people. In addition, we combine our experience to design this app, I believe 
										everyone has had the time when they cannot think of what to wear out, if this time there is a person who understands us to provide us with useful advice, this is how happy a thing. 
										Not only that, when you are anxious to find the T-shirts, you bought last year but have no idea where you put them, have you ever longed for an app that can help you find them. 
										Our app is the starting point to solve people's most basic problems and carry the basic control function of the smart home. If we can continue to work on this project, we will 
										give users a perfect changing experience in cloakroom.
									</p>
									<li id="five13"><h3>Landscape</h3></li>
									<p>Look today, many smart home apps are appearing in the market, such as Amazon's “Alexa”, Samsung's “smart things” and “AppleHome”, but none of the smart home apps are focused on the 
										cloakroom, a place with some personal privacy. Most of the smart home apps on the market are tied to their own devices, but our storage can accept different smart devices and simply 
										connect them to the app to control these devices, which I think is an innovation that should not be underestimated.
									</p>

						<!--Detailed Description-->
						<section id="five2">
							<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
								<ul>
									<li id="five21"><h3>Aims</h3></li>
									<p>The aim of our project is to design an intelligent cloakroom and a mobile phone intelligent application to help users interact with the cloakroom. 
										We hope to integrate innovative technology into modern life, and use technology, humanized design and intimate functions to help people store and 
										manage clothes. In addition, we hope that the cloakroom can not only facilitate people's life, but also bring reasonable clothing planning for 
										people who need to dress up, so that the life of users will become more interesting and colorful (Moen 2011).</p>
									<ul>
										<li type="square" style="color: white;">Goals</li>
										<p>In order to help us achieve the intelligent cloakroom and the design of mobile phone applications, we have set some small goals to promote the development of our project:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Understand people's needs for clothing today:<br>
												Now people's living standard is higher and higher, people's pursuit is also higher and higher, not only that, people's requirements for their own dress is also increasing, 
												people pay more attention to dress (BeTALIST 2016). Therefore, we need to understand today's people's needs for clothing, and introduce their needs into the design of our 
												intelligent cloakroom and wardrobe, which can not only meet people's needs, but also help our design become more reasonable.
											</li>
											<li>Study the structural design of the wardrobe and the whole cloakroom:<br>
												The internal structure design of the cloakroom and the wardrobe is very important for us, because its structure design will affect the clothing arrangement of the 
												intelligent wardrobe and the user's experience of using the cloakroom. Intelligent wardrobe has high requirements for the internal space, its structural design should not 
												affect the intelligent operation, so we need to reasonably arrange the internal space and make structural design changes according to the actual situation (Casto 2015). 
												In addition, in order to improve the user experience of the whole smart cloakroom, we need to design a more comfortable cloakroom structure to improve the user efficiency.
											</li>
											<li>Study the working and operating mode of intelligent cloakroom:<br>
												In order to improve the user experience of the intelligent cloakroom, we may need to refer to some of the intelligent cloakrooms that have been put into use in the market, 
												understand their current work and operation mode, learn their strengths, and find some aspects that we can improve the design, and then we can think about the design 
												direction of our mobile application according to this operation mode.
											</li>
											<li>Research on the interaction of mobile phone application with users and intelligent cloakroom:<br>
												Finally, we need to think about the interaction design of mobile applications. In today's application market, there are many intelligent application management software, 
												such as smart TV, air conditioning, and even curtains, which have corresponding mobile intelligent applications to control. For users of intelligent cloakroom, 
												they need to control the cloakroom intelligently, because in this way, they can arrange the operation of sorting clothes by themselves. This design is undoubtedly more 
												humanized and efficient.
											</li>											
										</ol>
										<p>As for our goals, the two most important aspects are the research on people's wearing needs and the structural design of intelligent cloakroom and wardrobe, because these 
											two are the most basic aspects of our project and the foundation of our project. Intelligent cloakroom is for the majority of users, and the needs of users have a guiding 
											role for our design direction. The structural design of cloakroom and wardrobe is the most important basis for the final realization and operation of our project. Without 
											the foreshadowing of these two aspects, our subsequent project plans can’t be carried out. Therefore, if the project is not carried out as expected, we need to devote most 
											of our time and energy to these two parts of the research, because their priority is no doubt, which is higher.
										</p>
									</ul>
									<li id="five22"><h3>Plans and Progress</h3></li>
									<ul>
										<li type="square" style="color: white;">The beginning of our project</li>
										<p>This project was originally the idea of our group's Zhongzheng Huang's personal project in Assignment 1. He hopes to introduce artificial intelligence into the design of today's 
											wardrobe, so as to help users better manage their own clothes, and the intelligent wardrobe can match the clothes for users to go out. This inspiration comes from the improvement 
											of people's attention to dress nowadays, people's increasing desire to buy clothes and the change of clothes will bring more opportunities and attraction to people. In Assignment 1, 
											Zhongzheng Huang widely understood some functions of artificial intelligence, and proposed the basic design idea of the original intelligent wardrobe: there is an intelligent digital 
											display screen in the middle of the wardrobe, and the user can control it through touch screen or mobile phone Bluetooth.
										</p><br>
										<p>After determining the design direction, the initial design ideas of intelligent wardrobe are mainly divided into the following aspects:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Add some AI devices and automation hardware equipment to the wardrobe:<br>
												The wardrobe needs to be equipped with a touchable intelligent digital display, the display screen can show the humidity and temperature in the wardrobe. 
												At the same time, users can also control it through remote control and mobile application.
											</li>
											<li>Add Bluetooth function to the wardrobe:<br>
												The introduction of Bluetooth function can help users connect with intelligent wardrobe through mobile phone Bluetooth. Of course, users can also control the operation through 
												mobile phones, which is convenient for users to manage the intelligent wardrobe anytime and anywhere.
											</li>
											<li>Use the display screen in the wardrobe to store the information of clothes in the database:<br>
												The user can scan the clothes in front of the display screen, the display screen will read the information of the clothes and store it in the database of the wardrobe, and then 
												record the position of the clothes. When the user needs to choose clothes to match when going out, the wardrobe can select suitable clothes for the user through the conditions 
												required by the user as a reference. After capturing a user, the system selects clothes from all pre-stored clothes in the clothing library that match the dressing instruction 
												and performs a simulated dressing procedure (Global IP News 2021). If the user confirms to wear, the system will provide the user with the location of the clothes, which is 
												convenient for the user to pick up the clothes quickly.
											</li>
											<li>Add intelligent products to the wardrobe for auxiliary functions:<br>
												The wardrobe will be equipped with intelligent devices such as automatic lifting lever and temperature sensor. The automatic lifting lever can help users adjust the height of 
												clothes and facilitate users to pick up clothes. Temperature sensor equipment can adjust the humidity and temperature inside the wardrobe, which is conducive to the preservation 
												of clothes.
											</li>
										</ol>

											The initial design of intelligent wardrobe needs a lot of tools and technical support. In addition to the programming language required by software, we also need to make a lot of 
											choices and research on hardware technology. At this stage, it is not an easy project for us to implement and develop, but we also find some fun in this project through research and 
											thinking. Therefore, we decided to continue this project, and try our best to constantly modify and innovate.
										</p>
										<li type="square" style="color: white;">How has the project progressed?</li>
										<p>After the establishment of smart wardrobe as a basic research project, our group is going to make some changes and innovations to the project in Assignment 2. Through the improvement 
											of functions and devices, our group hopes that the project will have more diversified changes and be more suitable for most consumers and users.
										</p><br>
										<p>In our Assignment 2, we have made some changes to the project itself. We hope to expand the design from a single intelligent wardrobe to an intelligent cloakroom. After the discussion 
											of our group, we think that many family houses are equipped with cloakrooms now, and people are used to dressing in the cloakroom. Therefore, if we choose to continue to design a 
											single intelligent wardrobe, then we can’t achieve good coverage effect and interaction for users in today's cloakroom (for example, if the cloakroom is equipped with a dresser and a 
											dressing mirror, then it is difficult for us to make a good intelligent connection and interaction between the intelligent wardrobe and the above two). Through our thinking and 
											discussion, we are ready to expand our project to the research and design of intelligent cloakroom.</p><br>
										<p>
											An intelligent mirror and a closet make up the clever cloakroom system. The intelligent mirror is linked to the wardrobe via a signal. The intelligent mirror has a clothing library 
											that corresponds to the garments in the wardrobe. An acquisition device and a confirmation device are also included in the intelligent cloakroom system (Global IP News 2021). 
											In the design of the cloakroom, we have retained the relevant functional design of Zhongzheng Huang in Assignment 1. We are going to keep his ideas in the design of the wardrobe 
											of the cloakroom. In addition, we have also made some other functional changes and added some new functional designs:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Intelligent emotional communication system<br>
												There will be a loudspeaker in the wardrobe. When the user enters the cloakroom, the loudspeaker in the wardrobe will use the set voice package to communicate with the user. 
												In addition, we will add a weight sensor to the wardrobe, and the wardrobe will give feedback to the user whether there are too many clothes according to the weight of the clothes.
											</li>
											<li>Intelligent face recognition system<br>
												We will put a dressing mirror with a smart camera in the cloakroom. When the user walks into the cloakroom, the mirror will turn on the camera, and obtain the user's information from 
												the recorded data, including basic information such as name, gender and age, to determine which family member the user is. If there is unrecorded person information, the system will 
												automatically take photos and send them to the e-mail address of the designated householder, which can play a certain role in security.
											</li> 
											<li>Intelligent environmental regulation system<br>
												We transfer the temperature sensor and humidity sensor in the wardrobe to the whole cloakroom. When the air in the cloakroom is too wet or the temperature is too high, the system will 
												automatically open the set solution to adjust to the humidity and temperature suitable for storing clothes, so as to prevent the clothes from moisture and mildew and improve the 
												comfort of users when changing clothes.
											</li>
											<li>Intelligent lighting system<br>
												When the user enters, the gateway and sensor will automatically adjust the light in the cloakroom. We hope that the light in the cloakroom will adopt different brightness at different times 
												to adapt to the environment at that time. In addition, we will also be equipped with sensors for the curtains, which will open automatically during the day, but close automatically at night.
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>After determining a series of functional requirements of our project, we also began to search for the required tools and technologies. Compared with the intelligent wardrobe in 
											Assignment 1, we added more artificial intelligence technologies (such as face recognition technology) into the new design. Therefore, artificial intelligence has also become our 
											main learning acknowledge in Assignment 2.
										</p>
										<li type="square" style="color: white;">Current progress and possible future development of our project</li>
										<p>After finishing the design of the intelligent cloakroom in Assignment 2, we are going to pay more attention to the function development of smart phone applications in Assignment 3. 
											A wide range of smart gadgets can now be accessed and operated regardless of their location thanks to the expanding use of internet and communication technology. A wide range of 
											smart gadgets can now be accessed and operated regardless of their location thanks to the expanding use of internet and communication technology (Aydin 2020). We hope to help users 
											manage their cloakroom anytime and anywhere by designing smart phone applications. In addition, it will be more convenient to manage the wardrobe on the mobile terminal, which is easy 
											for users to use daily.</p><br>
										<p>As for the function of mobile applications, our group has carried out a lot of discussion and research, finally we selected several representative mobile terminal operations and functions:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Intelligent switch remote control function:<br>
												Users can remotely control all kinds of intelligent switches in the cloakroom, such as light switch. Although our smart cloakroom has the function of automatic light adjustment, it does not 
												mean that the light adjusted by the system is suitable for all users, so users can adjust the light brightness they want at any time according to their own needs.
											</li>
											<li>Clothing storage and identification function:<br>
												Users can query the storage information and classification form of clothes in their wardrobe on the mobile application. When the user stores new clothes in the intelligent 
												cloakroom, the information will be synchronized to the user's mobile application after entering the clothes information in the intelligent cloakroom. The user can view the pictures and 
												related information of the clothes in the intelligent cloakroom on the mobile phone, which is convenient for the user to know the storage information of their clothes at any time. 
												In addition, the mobile app will analyze the user's favorite wearing styles according to the clothes stored by the user, and the app will recommend the wearing articles of relevant 
												styles for the user to read.
											</li>
											<li>Remote environment adjustment function:<br>
												Like the effect of light adjustment, the temperature and humidity environment set by the system may not be suitable for the users’ feeling when they are in the cloakroom. Therefore, 
												users can still adjust the temperature, humidity and other environmental factors in the cloakroom on the mobile application. Considering that most users only change clothes in the 
												cloakroom and will not stay too long, even if the temperature and other environment are changed by users, the clothes in the wardrobe will not be affected by the environment. After 
												users leave the cloakroom, the system will still adjust to the most suitable temperature and humidity environment for clothes preservation.
											</li>
											<li>Intelligent security function:<br>
												Safety is the premise of all activities, and also the primary requirement of residents for smart home system. We hope to install security detectors (such as smoke sensing, glass flaw 
												detection, mobile monitoring) for the smart cloakroom. Once a danger is detected, the alarm system will ring and automatically send messages to the mobile phones of family members 
												(Global IP News 2019). At the same time, the camera of the dressing mirror will provide 24-hour video monitoring for the cloakroom, and the user can check the image of the cloakroom 
												at any time on the mobile phone to confirm.
											</li>
											<li>Real time interaction function:<br>
												In Assignment 2, we set up the relevant functions of artificial intelligence for the cloakroom. The intelligent cloakroom will be equipped with a voice system, which can communicate 
												with users. In the mobile application, users can also interact with the system. For example, users can play music. The mobile terminal will synchronize the songs played in the mobile 
												phone to the intelligent cloakroom voice system. The system will play the music that users are listening to at the same time and record the songs. The next time users change clothes, 
												it can automatically play their favorite songs.
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>After defining the functions of the mobile application, our group decided to use Figma to design the prototype of our user interface to improve the usability of our application and achieve 
											the functions we designed as far as possible. In addition, we are also prepared to use a series of design principles, including Nelson's heuristics, to help us complete the interface design.
										</p><br>
										<p>
											For our group at this stage, we are not able to skillfully use all the required technologies and skills, so we have been constantly discussing and improving in the process of making prototypes. 
											No matter what the final design result is, we hope to make a complete project planning to help us continue to improve and achieve our project in the future.
										</p>
									</ul>
									<li id="five23"><h3>Roles</h3></li>
									<p>
										Even though our project is a difficult idea, we are going to realize it with only few people. On the one hand, fewer people means less expenditure so that company can solve more problem like updating 
										application and marketing survey. On the other hand, few people are easier to communication and co-operation in one company. The figure below also shows that half of application development companies 
										in UK have only 5 staff. Therefore, we are going to set positions followed.
									</p>
									<span><img src="assets/css/images/Role.png" height="700px"></span><br>
									<br>
									<ul>
										<li>Marketing representative manager:<br>
											Marketing survey is an indispensable part before we start our project. Therefore, marketing representative manager have to do completed user survey and give an analysis report to other 
											in this team. In our project, marketing representative manager must interview some people who are lack of time to consider how to dress on a regular basis. The manager also need to 
											find out the main problem in users’ daily dress style and collect users’ requirement in clothes. After analyzing those survey, marketing representative manager ought to complete a 
											report which is helpful for designer to learn about users.
										</li><br>
										<li>Mobile Application designer:<br>
											Front-end design and back-end design are significant before one application development. Front-end designer is responsible to application interface. According to recent research, 
											94 percent of people develop their first impression of a website based only on its appearance, and a strong UX design can increase website conversion rates by 400%. As a result, 
											an increasing number of businesses are concentrating their efforts on hiring a top web or app design firm to assist them in developing a conversion-oriented solution (PR Newswire, 2021). 
											Therefore, it is significant for interface designer to make this application with great UX design. In terms of back-end designer who ought to read report of marketing representative 
											manager and understand users’ requirement  in clothes well so that he/she can design the more functions in this one application. The function designer have to communicating with 
											developer and consider how to increase new functions or delete unnecessary functions during application development phase.
										</li><br>
										<li>Mobile Application developer:<br>
											Developer is the key role to realize the application. In this project, developer need to use AI knowledge and big data analysis to give dressing recommendation to users. Developer 
											ought to communicate with designer about how to realize functions and interface and be responsible to update application.
										</li><br>
										<li>Product manager:<br>
											Product manager is the leader of this team, who have to communicate with customers and follow up the progress on a regular basis. It's thrilling to create fantastic items. It takes 
											a group of dedicated, motivated, and passionate team members who perform to the best of their abilities in their respective roles. Amazing things may happen when a group of people 
											with similar goals and complementary skills get together.( de Haaff, Brian, 2015)
										</li>
									</ul>

									<li id="five24"><h3>Scope and Limits</h3></li>
									<p>In our project, it is difficult to realize the design and function of whole closet. Therefore, we are going to design and realize the functions of application in a short time. We will 
										develop an mobile application which can help users to choose clothes or give them recommendations of dress style in different clothes. In this phase, we are only focus on application 
										in mobile devices and some function of cloakrooms. Therefore, we are only need to software developers and designers, which can help us save a lot of time and budget. 
										If our application can attract a large number of users, we are going to take whole AI cloakroom into our plan.
									</p>
									<p>There are five main function we have mentioned in this report. However, we due to limits, we can’t realize the whole function in the short time.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Intelligent switch remote control function:<br>
											In this function, we have to spend a range of time and budget to realize a whole cloakroom and we have to develop this function in app to control it. Therefore, we won’t take this 
											function into consideration when we have not designed and developed a whole cloakroom.
										</li>
										<li>Clothing storage and identification function:<br>
											We are going to develop this function in our mobile application. However, users are only required to fill in information of their clothes rather than full in data in AI cloakroom. 
											It is easier to realize this function with less budget.
										</li>
										<li>Remote environment adjustment function:<br>
											Due to the limits, we can only design this function in application first. In this function, application will give users recommendations to store clothes in different weather. When users use the 
											cloakroom, the application will still advise user to adjust to the suitable temperature and humidity environment for clothes preservation.
										</li>
										<li>Intelligent security function:<br>
											We are going to realize this whole function due to the fact that furniture security is significant for users. According to a Pitt County Sheriff's Office complaint, someone broke into a 
											28-year-old man's residence in the 2700 block of Old Creek Road on Wednesday and stole a $600 dresser, a $600 chest of drawers, a $1,200 computer, a $25 lamp, $50 in photos, a $100 
											stereo, a $200 amplifier, and a $75 DVD player.( Daily Reflector,2007). The furniture set was stolen overnight between July 1 and 2 from a rear garden in Craigview.( Stirling Observer, 
											2013). The fact that there are a range of case of stolen furniture tells us we have to develop a function in cloakroom to protect the security of home.
										</li>
										<li>Real time interaction function:<br>
											For this function, it is lack of practicability. Therefore, if we have little budget, we won’t develop this function preferentially. However, we are going to collect attitude of users 
											and consider add this function in the future.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<li id="five25"><h3>Tools and Technologies</h3></li>
									<ol>
										<li>Cloakroom design skill:<br>
											A whole cloakroom must be designed at first. The author, a Web designer, proposes that today's furniture "could analyze information about its environment, users, and other gadgets to be 
											more practical and elegant," and he lists ten characteristics that would make "dumb" furniture "smart."  ( Kuniavsky,2004). The cloakroom must be designed as a completed AI and it can 
											interact with users. Xiaozhou Jiang in our team is good for industry design and she have knowledge of AI development as well. That means that she learns about AI how to be developed 
											and used. Therefore, she can design a whole cloakroom by learning relative knowledge.
										</li>
										<li>Interface design skill:<br>
											Every application development need interface design. People who are responsible to interface design ought to master front-end development and have design experience. Yangfeng in our team 
											even had a high mark in courses user centered design and he is skillful for web front-end development. We believe that he can do it well after learning mobile application design and 
											design software like figma.
										</li>
										<li>Mobile application development skill:<br>
											Before cloakroom development, we have to complete all functions in mobile application. As a student who are crazy about back-end development, Jingxuan Long have mastered 
											popular programming language like JAVA and PHP which is useful for application development and he have completed few little website and application like satisfaction survey 
											app and shopping app. However, Jingxuan Long have less experience on development of mobile application. Therefore, he is going to learn about how to develop application in 
											mobile devices in the future.
										</li>
										<li>AI skill:<br>
											Due to the fact that our project ought to have interaction with users, AI skill is essential for our teams. However, in our team, few of us have knowledge of AI. On the one 
											hand, we have to learn development of AI. SuperEdge, as Aetina's NVIDIA NGC-Ready AI inference platform and AI training machine, enables developers to learn machine learning 
											faster and provides vital support for the edge solution management platform.( PR Newswire Asia, 2021). Therefore, AI learning machine is significant for our team. On the other 
											hand, we ought to look for AI professional staff and consult relative issue of AI. We can ask any problems to him when we face with problem in development.
										</li>

									</ol>
									<li id="five26"><h3>Testing</h3></li>
									<p>
										For this project, we use the functional decomposition testing method, which is suitable for multifunctional projects. We will test each section separately. First is the intelligent 
										environment adjustment function, the checkroom will be installed with a central microprocessor, which receives electrical signals from other temperature sensors, light sensors, etc.. 
										The first test is to see if the sensors work properly, and then to see if the CPU can receive the signals from the sensors. So that it can work properly. In terms of safety features, 
										the camera should be tested for operation and connection, and the smoke detector should be tested to see if it can send an alarm when the smoke reaches a sufficient concentration and 
										send it to the mobile via the network. Smart clothing storage, to ensure that the user-defined content can be stored in the database, so to test the database read and write functions 
										and connectivity. The final test is to test all the functions after the product is made successfully, to simulate all the real use, so we will set different 5 age groups as samples, 
										a month-long test, each age group is then divided into three groups according to the frequency of use, after a month, we will summarize their use and then prepare for the subsequent 
										improvements and tests.

											The time frame for the next few weeks is mainly used to build this application. Divided into multiple stages to test this application, to achieve our expected results. 
											Then a lot of testing can be done to ensure the feasibility of the application. Finally, this smart home app can be promoted. Because our application needs to be connected 
											to the user's home device, this will allow users to consider their privacy and security issues. We will also ask network security experts to help us, and we will not 
											interfere in the background, and will prevent other criminals from trying to connect to the device to ensure the security of private information and the security of the device.

									<li id="five28"><h3>Risks</h3></li>
									<p>
										A project development process will encounter many difficulties, many things can affect the success or failure of software development, the risk is the possibility of a series of 
										events or adverse results in the project, software development is a high-risk activity, there may be risks at every stage, our project may also be though in the potential risk. 
										For example.<br>
										In terms of planning, our workload estimates were so optimistic that we did not allow enough time to develop the software. In terms of organizational management, we lacked 
										strong, cohesive leadership, so our work assignments were negotiated but humane. In terms of the development environment, we used Figma to create the interface of the software, 
										which was rather single-function and could not meet our higher requirements, and it was also difficult to use and would be slow to respond. There are also risks with the 
										product, for example, first, if the power goes out at home due to some factor, then these together functions will not work, and the same goes for the network connection, once 
										the network is disconnected, the mobile cannot connect to the furniture and it will not be possible to control the furniture remotely. Secondly, although our interface is simple 
										and convenient enough, there are cases that some elderly people and children may not be able to operate it.
									</p>
									<li id="five29"><h3>Group process and communications</h3></li>
									<p>
										In terms of communication, we will communicate with each other through MS teams and Wechat. On teams, we have two meetings every week, about 30 minutes each time. We will report 
										the progress of the assignment, discuss the ideas of the project, and sometimes work together to complete some parts that need brainstorming, share links, and so on. On WeChat, 
										we will carry out daily communication and file sharing, which is very convenient. We get in touch almost every day because homework is very important, new progress is made almost 
										every day, communication is always happy and relaxed, every member will get in touch in time so that the project can be carried out smoothly, which is great.

				<!--Skills and Jobs-->
				<section id="six" class="wrapper style5 fullscreen fade-up">
					<div class="inner">
						<h1>Skills and Jobs</h1>
						<p>In this section, the group have discussed the main roles we would recruit if the project was funded for an additioal 6 months.</p>
						<ul>
							<li style="color: white;"><h3>Product Manager (PM)</h3></li>
							<p>
								The product manager is a link between the project demander and the software development engineer. He not only needs to make corresponding project analyses and project 
								diagnoses according to the demand document of the product demander but also provides project flow charts and project prototypes for the later development of the project. 
								Figure, so that the most time can be saved during development, and at the same time, to ensure that developers can develop in accordance with customer needs to prevent 
								misunderstandings during project development. At the same time, the project manager will combine his own experience according to the needs of the project with the enterprise 
								or entrepreneur The author has more development suggestions.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								The teamwork experience of the product manager needs to be very rich. Because this project is a smart home app. Therefore, product managers also need to have sufficient 
								expertise in developing apps and smart homes. In the next six months, more users may be generated. Then you need to collect user feedback, knowing the user's needs, can make 
								the project more perfect.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								The leadership ability of the product manager needs to be strong. In the follow-up work, the product manager spends most of the time in the core role of the team, and naturally 
								shoulders the role of team management. The product manager needs to communicate closely with colleagues to understand their work situation and resource allocation, and then make 
								a reasonable schedule based on the requirements of the product. When colleagues report the weekly progress, the product manager keeps a record so that the progress can be clearly grasped.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								As the core member of the product team and the full-time product manager, the product manager must shoulder the main responsibility of product innovation. Therefore, product managers need 
								to continuously accumulate experience and knowledge, think more actively, not easily criticize and deny, make full use of external information and learn to "imitation and improve." 
								In the next six months of development, lead the team to innovate projects.
							</p><br>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li style="color: white;"><h3>UI Designer</h3></li>
							<p>
								UI design focuses on the user's visual experience. It determines how the user interacts with the interface, whether it is an application, a video game, or a website. The job of a UI 
								designer is to design all the screens in which the user will move, and create visual elements and their interactive attributes that contribute to that movement. So to develop the 
								project, we need professional UI designers to do a good job of page design for our smart home app, which can bring users a better experience in terms of vision and experience.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								In our smart home app project, the app interface is the first impression it brings to users. Designing a beautiful page can directly attract users. In the future, the corresponding 
								official website may also be developed, and UI designers are also required to design the layout of the webpage. In future software updates, for the emergence of some new smart homes 
								and the emergence of new functions, some modifications need to be made on the interface, which requires the help of UI designers. Innovation in interface design is also the key to 
								attracting users.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								In the subsequent teamwork, communication is the key to UI design. When handing over the design to the developer, the UI designer needs to effectively communicate the intended 
								function of each element of the design. The designed interface also needs to meet the requirements of the product manager and meet the needs of users. Putting accessibility and 
								inclusiveness first is essential to creating an interface that all users will love. So establishing rapport and being able to communicate clearly across different teams is 
								essential to the success of the project.
							</p><br>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li style="color: white;"><h3>Software Development Engineer</h3></li>
							<p>
								The software development engineer completes the writing of the program code part in strict accordance with the analysis and planning of the product manager, including the design of the database. 
								It is also necessary to write programs in accordance with the button logic, page logic, and functions provided by the UI designer. Our goal is still to develop a smart home app. 
								In terms of function and device connection, it must be comprehensive. Also consider product positioning, functions, and hardware limitations. Write the appropriate code to create an 
								excellent smart home app.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								To expand the project, it is necessary to make the app more attractive to users, beautiful in the interface, and complete in functions. In another six months of development, the number of users 
								will increase, and the needs of users will also increase. Does the communication protocol use WiFi or Bluetooth? What is the app user group, iOS or Android? Software development 
								engineers need to improve the code for these so that more user groups can use this app. And there may be more smart homes in the future, so development engineers are needed to build 
								the connection between the app and the home.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								An excellent software development engineer can help the team solve many technical problems. As the product is upgraded, then our control code also needs to be upgraded. Regular software 
								updates and troubleshooting require technical personnel. Through upgrading and updating, the functions of the app are more simple and comprehensive. Or there are some functions that 
								we didn't expect, and the development engineers have realized them through technology, which also meets the needs of product managers and users. This is of great benefit to the project.
							</p><br>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li style="color: white;"><h3>Cybersecurity expert</h3></li>
							<p>
								Cybersecurity experts are responsible for providing security during the development phase of software systems, networks, and data centers. Professionals must search for vulnerabilities and risks 
								in hardware and software. They manage and monitor any attacks and intrusions. Security experts must identify potential threats or attempts to sabotage by closing security holes. 
								There are network security experts to ensure that our project is safe and that the project can continue to develop normally.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								As the project continues to develop, the use of apps may also increase. Network security experts must not only help protect users’ personal information, database security, and smart home connection app security. Network security experts should also check whether the increase in usage will cause the software server to freeze. Will not cause the system to crash. Other security issues require the help of network security experts. 
								It is also necessary to regularly investigate and deal with vulnerabilities to prevent criminals from using a certain channel to gain control of the user's smart home.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								A professional network security expert can not only bring us security technical information, but also expand our projects, the security of device connections, the security of user 
								information, and give users a real sense of security. Follow-up development also requires long-term use of the equipment. If the company or other colleagues encounter network security 
								problems, it can also help. Using the professional knowledge of cyber security experts to help us can save a lot of time for our projects.

									In this assignment, I have learned about our project more exactly. Our project is AI cloakroom and a mobile application. For the mobile application 
									part, I have learned how to develop it in last assignment. Therefore, I add more details in my part. For AI cloakroom part, I have read a large number 
									of professional article and I learned that the exactly progress of AI cloakroom development. However, I consider I have to know the technical skills 
									which are mastered by my teammates and write them in our assignment. Therefore, I send email and ask them one by one and assumed different roles in our 
									project according to their skills and experience. Even though I face with difficulties in technologies and tools in that I have little idea of them, 
									I ask professional IT staff and look for related information on the internet. Furthermore, Our daily meeting is meaningful and we discuss different ideas 
									and share technical skills in MS teams, which teaches me how to communicate with teammates and solve problems in work with IT staff in the future. When I 
									feel confused about our assignment, I ask my teammates and they would share the data which they collect, which is truly helpful for our report.

									I think the assignment went very well for our group. Everyone was very positive and no one wanted to get away with not completing the assignment at 
									the beginning. They were able to express their ideas and accept others' opinions with openness. Although the group's work went very well, I was not 
									very satisfied with the speed of completion, probably because there were other assignments, so no one submitted their parts very fast. I thought it 
									would be difficult to coordinate the work, but to my surprise, everyone worked very hard and was very motivated to get the job done.Compared to the 
									last assignment, the group was more comfortable with this assignment because we had accumulated a lot of experience from the previous assignment. We 
									all had a clear idea of what we needed to accomplish and were able to provide different ideas for the whole project, which was not the case in the 
									previous assignment.<br>
									So I think what I learned from this group is how to communicate and coordinate effectively, to be bold in expressing my ideas and to be open to 
									others' suggestions.

									Through this group work, I understand the importance of communication, our team members cooperate very well, and everyone actively participates 
									in every conference call.Not only that, but when considering how to upgrade and expand our project, the group members have offered a lot of 
									constructive ideas and no one is not contributing to the development of our group. I think there is only one shortcoming in our group, which is 
									that many times people may seldom raise objections, basically agreeing and obeying. I think maybe having some objections will make our project more 
									innovative, but of course this point will not bring too much impact on our project. All in all, it was another new group collaboration experience, 
									where everyone was playing to their strengths and bringing the whole group to a better place, and I gained a lot of experience in group collaboration, 
									which was a very memorable collaboration experience.

									In Assignment 3, I sorted out and summarized the aims and progress of the group project. In this assignment, I deeply felt the importance of group 
									cooperation. In the process of the project, each member of the team expressed their different views on the project and put forward a lot of good suggestions, 
									but it is very difficult to unify these views. Therefore, our group has had a lot of discussions, and we have learned how to communicate among group members 
									and how to use more effective ways to carry out cooperation between groups. Through the summary of the group project process, I also feel that each team member 
									has invested a lot of energy in the project to complete the task, and I have learned a lot of valuable learning skills from my partners. I think that by completing 
									the project idea of this course, I will have a clearer learning direction and learning methods in the future.

									During this assignment, it went smoothly, everyone worked hard to complete the previously scheduled work and worked together as a team more 
									efficiently than individually. During this study, I learned more in-depth knowledge about IT. These technological developments have the potential 
									to affect the lives of large and small businesses and individuals. It became clearer that the most important thing in doing a project is good risk 
									management and testing as well as communication among members, which are important factors in determining the success of the project. During this 
									project, there was a clear division of labor and everyone did their best, and the other team members were very helpful and eager to answer questions 
									for me.

								<p style="font-size: 20px; color: white;">
									In this assignment, I was assigned to write the "skills and jobs" part. After discussion in the group, the posts we chose were product manager, 
									UI designer, software engineer, and cybersecurity expert. In these four posts, I have looked up a lot of information. I have learned more information 
									about these posts. We first analyzed what the future development of our project is, what is needed, and how to do it. Then began to write about the 
									experience, skills, etc. required for these posts. What kind of help can it bring to our project development? There are many points to consider, and 
									I will try my best to describe them one by one. In terms of project proposal, it also spent a lot of effort, so that our team has an overall idea, and 
									it is convenient to carry out follow-up work. The views on these topics were also discussed in the group. In the last project, we also discussed a lot. 
									The team members helped each other and worked together to complete the project. In these few teamwork, I also grew up and learned a lot. Need more to 
									communicate, to discuss, to help each other, unity and cooperation is the main point of the team to complete the task.

								In Assignment3, we have carried out group communication more smoothly. This is where we have made progress compared with the previous group assignment. 
								In the whole part of project ideas and project description, each member has a lot of ideas and suggestions. However, it is very difficult to summarize everyone's 
								ideas, so our group has a long discussion. Compared with the previous assignment, we are more efficient in this group discussion. Members can understand other 
								people's goals well and make concessions, and finally help the project develop quickly.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>What could be improved<br>
									Through the completion of Assignment 3, we think our group needs to improve the practical ability of the project. We summed up a lot of project ideas in this 
									group project. Some of these ideas were very imaginative, but there were great difficulties in practice. In the progress of the project, we had a lot of 
									technologies that we hoped to add to our project, such as programming and tools related to artificial intelligence, but the effect of the final practice was 
									not ideal. In addition, due to the epidemic situation, all group members carried out project research in different places, which brought great trouble to our 
									cooperation. For some project ideas, we were unable to carry out effective practice, and we lacked sufficient experience to promote our project exploration. 
									Therefore, to complete all our project ideas, we may need more time to carry out continuous research and practice. However, through this project, we also know 
									our own technical deficiencies, and we will continue to improve ourselves in the future.
								</li><br>
								<li>Things that were surprising<br>
									In Assignment 3, what surprised us most was that our group members' communication ability was getting better and better, and our group members were getting to 
									know each other more and more. In the previous group cooperation, we were often unable to understand other people's views well, we had a lot of arguments in the 
									previous project ideas, and finally there was no unified idea. As a result, our previous cooperation projects were carried out very slowly at the initial stage, 
									it's often very late for us to have the same goal. However, in this assignment process, we can quickly establish a clear stage goal, and the group members can 
									quickly understand each other's ideas, which also helps us not to waste a lot of time for meaningless discussion. Each member can quickly start their own tasks, 
									and the efficiency of the whole project is very high. In addition, even though we still have a lot of technical deficiencies at this stage. However, compared with 
									the previous group task, we can put forward more professional ideas this time, we can use more professional articles to help us complete the project report, and our 
									academic thinking has been improved.
								</li><br>
								<li>Things we have learned about groups<br>
									In this group work, we have a deeper understanding of the importance of group cooperation. For a large project plan and project objectives, we need to carry out group 
									cooperation to jointly promote the development of this project. In the previous cooperation, we often immersed ourselves in our own tasks and we didn’t have group 
									communication when we encountered difficulties. However, through this assignment, the communication among members really helped us to solve the difficulties existing 
									in our respective tasks. Group cooperation is a very valuable lesson for all of us. In addition, we have also learned how to cooperate with partners to complete the 
									same task. We have learned that the efforts of members complement each other. Only when everyone works towards the same goal can our project achieve a good result.
