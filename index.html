									<h2>Team EMO_Jingxuan Long</h2>
									<h3>s3860956</h3>
									<p>Hi, I'm Long Jingxuan, you can call me Robert. I'm a sophomore at RMIT. 
										I speak Chinese but I would like to meet people from other cultures. I'm crazy about movies and video games. 
										I'm deeply interested in creating something useful for ordinary people like websites or software. 
										That’s why I prefer software development. Moreover, I'm crazy to learn about IT knowledge and 
										enjoy learning new knowledge and use them in my programs. I pay attention to mini program development regularly. 
										Therefore, I have once made a whole satisfaction survey program for some little company.</p>
